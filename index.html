<h1> Background and Ambitions</h1>

<p>
 First off my background, I am currently a junior at Illinois Institute of Technology.I am majoring in Digital Humanities. Before transferring to Illinois Tech, I received my Associates in Arts at Morton College. At Morton, I was a member of the cross country team and basketball team. I graduated as an honors student. I'm also on the Women's Basketball team. 

<p>
My passions are running and fitness, nutrition, basketball, and writing. I have competed in multiple running events such as a full marathon and a Spartan Sprint. I also participate in CrossFit. I have always been interested in writing ever since I learned how in elementary school. It has always been a way to communicate my emotions and ideas with others. While others use musical instruments and paintbrushes to be creative, I used the power of words. That being said, learning basic web design would be another way to spread my ideas and showcase my writing.

My ambitions aren't quite set in stone yet. As of right now I would like to complete and have a beautiful and fully functional webpage for the mobile space. My other goals are to pursue a career where I can write and be creative, continue to grow and be ultimately happy. Hopefully successful too. I would also like to one day complete and publish a novel as well as run a few more marathons.
