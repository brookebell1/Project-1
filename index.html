<h1> Background and Ambitions</h1>

<p>
 First off my background, I am currently a junior at Illinois Institute of Technology. Before transferring to Illinois Tech, I received my Associates in Arts at Morton College where I was also a member of the cross country team and basketball team. I graduated as an honors student. I am majoring in Digital Humanities. I'm also on the Women's Basketball team.

My passions are running and fitness, basketball, and writing. I have competed in multiple running events such as a full marathon and a Spartan Sprint. I also participate in CrossFit. I have always been interested in writing ever since I learned how in elementary school. It was a way to communicate my emotions and ideas with others. That being said, learning basic web design would be another way to spread my ideas and showcase my writing.
